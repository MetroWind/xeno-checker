= XenoChecker
MetroWind

A check list for Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition.

Currently there is a quest checklist and a unique monster checklist.
Checked items are saved in your browser’s local storage. Optimized for
mobile browsers. (What I’m trying to say is it’s not optimized for
desktop...)

The Python script is to scrap the Xenoblade wiki and generate the two
XMLs in the web directory.
